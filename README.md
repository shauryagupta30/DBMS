# Database Management Systems

1.	Choose a mini world for design and implementation of itâ€™s a database assigning an appropriate title for the database.	(2)
2.	Write down the data requirements and functional requirements for the database (in approximately 1500 words). The data requirements, apart from data to be stored in the database should also take into account the necessary integrity constraints that are reasonable for the database under consideration. The functional requirements should involve at least two different scenarios of removal of old data, at least two different scenarios for modification of existing data and four different scenarios of data retrieval.	(10)
3.	Draw an ER/EER diagram based on the data requirements. Indicate key constraints, cardinality constraints and participation constraints on the diagram.	(8)
4.	Convert the ER/EER diagram into a relational database schema diagram.	(15)
5.	Implement the relational database schema incorporating appropriate (based on data requirements) integrity constraints and enter necessary sample data into the tables.	(15)
6.	Write down the necessary SQL statements for implementation of functional requirements through SQL query, delete and update statement.	(15)
7.	Define and implement one PL/SQL function and one PL/SQL procedure appropriate for the database under consideration.	(10)
8.	Define two business rules appropriate for the database under consideration and implement the rules using trigger.
(15)
9.	Submission of the complete project document.	(10)

# Extra Non-Credit assignment:
Storage Manager:
Implement Extendible Hash Table


Task #1 - build a general purpose hash table that uses unordered buckets to store unique key/value pairs.

Task #2 - LRU Page Replacement Policy :his component is responsible for tracking the usage of pages in the buffer pool.

Task #3 - Buffer Pool Manager : implement the buffer pool manager in your system (BufferPoolManager). 
It is responsible for fetching database pages from the DiskManager and storing them in memory.
